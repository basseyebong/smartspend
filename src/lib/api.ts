  return `Financial Risk Analysis Report:

üîç **Risk Assessment Score: 65/100** (Moderate Risk)

**Key Risk Factors:**
1. **Cash Flow Risk (Medium)**: Monthly expenses occasionally exceed 90% of income
2. **Emergency Fund Risk (High)**: Current emergency fund covers only 1.2 months of expenses
3. **Debt Risk (Low)**: Manageable debt levels with good payment history
4. **Investment Risk (Medium)**: Portfolio lacks diversification

**Predictions:**
- 25% chance of budget overspend in next 3 months
- 15% probability of emergency fund depletion within 6 months
- 60% likelihood of meeting savings goals if current trends continue

**Recommendations:**
1. Increase emergency fund to 3 months of expenses
2. Implement stricter budget controls for variable expenses
3. Diversify investment portfolio across asset classes
4. Set up automatic savings to reduce spending temptation

**Health Score Breakdown:**
- Spending Control: 70/100
- Savings Rate: 60/100
- Debt Management: 85/100
- Emergency Preparedness: 40/100
- Investment Strategy: 55/100`;
